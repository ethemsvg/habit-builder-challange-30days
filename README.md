# habit-builder-challange-30days
Just a small program that runs on terminal to track your progress while trying to get used to a new habit, and i tried to keep it as minimal as possible since the other apps can sometimes distract me.

Rules:
  - You have to use the app every single day for a month and register your progress for the day.
  - You can only miss 8 times; if you miss it the 9th time, your progress will be reset.
  - After a month, you will earn a badge which is basically a part on the program's interface that shows the habits you have completed successfully.
  - Do not try to break the program on purpose :) as i haven't spent much time on writing the code so it may be a little sloppy when you enter bad inputs.
  - The program cannot track whether you skipped a day or not, so it's your responsibility to run it every single day and register your progress.
  
  This one is not about the program, but i don't suggest you to attempt to work on too many habits at the same time.
